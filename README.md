# ALL IN A VAGRANT VM

1. Download Vagrant ([https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html))
2. Clone this repo 
  ```bash
  /> git clone -b Docker https://github.com/Micka33/coursestovacuum.git .
  ```
3. Create the VM
  ```
  /> vagrant up
  ```
4. Connect using SSH to the VM
  ```
  /> vagrant ssh
  ```
5. DONE! You can now use docker! (you will have to run docker commands using `sudo`)

## Don't want to use vagrant ?

Go to the docker folder [https://github.com/Micka33/coursestovacuum/tree/Docker/docker](https://github.com/Micka33/coursestovacuum/tree/Docker/docker).
